# The quotation rules for here-strings are slightly different.
# A here-string is a single-quoted or double-quoted string in which quotation marks are interpreted literally. A here-string can span multiple lines. All the lines in a here-string are interpreted as strings even though they are not enclosed in quotation marks.
# Like regular strings, variables are replaced by their values in double-quoted here-strings. In single-quoted here-strings, variables are not replaced by their values.
